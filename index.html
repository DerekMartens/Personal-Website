                                I have a Bachelor's of Science, Computer Science from the University of Manitoba, with a minor in management. I also completed three different concentrations; software engineering, human-computer interaction, and databases. During my studies, I completed courses covering a wide range of topics, from Entrepreneurship to Operating Systems.

                                Since September of last year, I have been working for the University of Manitoba as the intramural hockey coordinator. My job had me oversee hiring and management, including payroll and scheduling, of 11 employees, serving approximately 350 active participants. I really enjoyed the job as it allowed me to meet many new people as well as hone my management skills. 
                                <br><br>
                                Before that, I worked for IDC Communications for nearly 6 years in several different positions. I started as a greeter for a few months. I was then promoted to a sales associate position and did that job for around 4 years. I then transferred to an office administration position where I was able to work on some VBA development projects that were used in the accounting department.

                                Aside from work or school, I have many other interests. I love playing sports with friends, like hockey and golf. I've been apart of various beer-league teams since moving to Winnipeg. 
                                <br><br>
                                I also enjoy various genres of video games, including Call of Duty and Minecraft. I use Minecraft as a means to spend time with younger family members that live in other provinces. I also recently joined the U of M Minecraft Club as an Alumnus to connect with current students.
                                <br><br>
                                Finally, I enjoy spending a relaxing weekend at the lake with my friends. Going wakeboarding and talking around the fire is a great way to wind down after a busy week.
